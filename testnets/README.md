# IBC Relayer Testnets

These are instructions on how to setup a node to run a basic IBC relayer testnet. Currently, coordination is happening in the [`ibc-testnet-alpha` group on telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/IYdbxRRFYIkj9FR99X3-BA).

### *19 March 2020 17:00 PST* - `relayer-alpha` testnet

This is the first `relayer` testnet! Please submit your JSON files for this testnet to `./testnets/relayer-alpha/{{chain_id}}.json`.

## Testnet Node Setup
In order to run a node in this testnet, you need to run it from a server of some sort. This guide is agnostic to a specific cloud provider. The instructions assume you have SSH access w/ `sudo` on the server. While setting up the server, ensure that ports `:8000` (`faucet`) and `:26657` (`gaiad`) are open and accessable.

> NOTE: You can and should (:wink:) setup a DNS A record pointing to your server to make the URL human readable instead of an IP address. Many services make this easy. I'm using https://domains.google.com.

### Server Setup

The following instructions have been tested and are working from a default install of Ubuntu on a shared CPU instance w/ 2GB RAM.

```bash
# Update the system and install dependancies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential jq -y

# Install latest go version https://golang.org/doc/install
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.14.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.14.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Add $GOPATH, $GOBIN and both to $PATH
echo "" >> ~/.profile
echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> ~/.profile
echo 'export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin' >> ~/.profile
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOBIN' >> ~/.profile
echo "export GAIA=\$GOPATH/src/github.com/cosmos/gaia" >> ~/.profile
echo "export RELAYER=\$GOPATH/src/github.com/iqlusioninc/relayer" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile

# Set these variables to different values that are specific to your chain
# Also, ensure they are set to make the commands below run properly
export DENOM=pylon
export CHAINID=pylonchain
export DOMAIN=shitcoincasinos.com
export RLYKEY=faucet

# Start by downloading and installing both gaia and the relayer
mkdir -p $(dirname $GAIA) && git clone https://github.com/cosmos/gaia $GAIA && cd $GAIA && git checkout ibc-alpha && make install
mkdir -p $(dirname $RELAYER) && git clone https://github.com/iqlusioninc/relayer $RELAYER && cd $RELAYER && make install

# Now its time to configure both the relayer and gaia, start with the relayer
cd
rly config init
echo "{\"key\":\"$RLYKEY\",\"chain-id\":\"$CHAINID\",\"rpc-addr\":\"http://$DOMAIN:26657\",\"account-prefix\":\"cosmos\",\"gas\":200000,\"gas-prices\":\"0.025$DENOM\",\"default-denom\":\"$DENOM\",\"trusting-period\":\"330h\"}" > $CHAINID.json
# NOTE: you will want to save the content from this JSON file
rly chains add -f $CHAINID.json
rly keys add $CHAINID $RLYKEY

# Move on to configuring gaia
gaiad init --chain-id $CHAINID $CHAINID
# NOTE: ensure that the gaia rpc is open to all connections
sed -i 's#tcp://127.0.0.1:26657#tcp://0.0.0.0:26657#g' ~/.gaiad/config/config.toml
sed -i "s/stake/$DENOM/g" ~/.gaiad/config/genesis.json
sed -i 's/pruning = "syncable"/pruning = "nothing"/g' ~/.gaiad/config/app.toml
gaiacli keys add validator

# Now its time to construct the genesis file
gaiad add-genesis-account $(gaiacli keys show validator -a) 100000000000$DENOM,10000000samoleans
gaiad add-genesis-account $(rly keys show $CHAINID $RLYKEY -a) 10000000000000$DENOM,10000000samoleans
gaiad gentx --name validator --amount 90000000000$DENOM
gaiad collect-gentxs

# Setup the service definitions
rly testnets gaia-service $USER $HOME > gaiad.service
rly testnets faucet-service $USER $HOME $CHAINID $RLYKEY 100000$DENOM > faucet.service
sudo mv gaiad.service /etc/systemd/system/gaiad.service
sudo mv faucet.service /etc/systemd/system/faucet.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start gaiad
sudo systemctl start faucet

# Server _should_ be ready to go!
# Be sure you have the text from ~/$CHAINID.json for the next step
```

### Local Setup
Once you have your server 

```bash
# install the relayer
export RELAYER=$GOPATH/src/github.com/iqlusioninc/relayer
mkdir -p $(dirname $RELAYER) && git clone git@github.com:iqlusioninc/relayer $RELAYER && cd $RELAYER
make install

# then to configure your local relayer to talk to your remote chain
# get the json from $CHAINID.json on your server
rly cfg init
rly ch add -f {{chain_id}}.json

# create a local rly key for the chain
rly keys add {{chain_id}} testkey

# confiure the chain to use that key by default
rly ch edit {{chain_id}} key testkey

# initialize the lite client for {{chain_id}}
rly lite init {{chain_id}} -f

# request funds from the faucet to test it
rly tst request {{chain_id}} testkey

# you should see a balance for the rly key now
rly q bal {{chain_id}}
```

### Submit your {{chain_id}}.json to the relayer repo

Finally, open a pull request with the JSON required to configure a connection to your chain to the `testnets/relayer-alpha/{{chain_id}}.json`. You should be able to connect with other members of the relayer alpha testnet!
