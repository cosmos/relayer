The Cosmos ecosystem believes that strong security is a blend of highly
technical security researchers who care about security and the forward
progression of the ecosystem and the attentiveness and openness of Cosmos core
contributors to help continually secure our operations.

### Guidelines

We require that all researchers:

* Abide by this policy to disclose vulnerabilities, and avoid posting
  vulnerability information in public places, including GitHub, Discord,
  Telegram, and Twitter.
* Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience,
  disruption to production systems (including but not limited to the Cosmos
  Hub), and destruction of data.
* Keep any information about vulnerabilities that youâ€™ve discovered confidential
  between yourself and the Cosmos engineering team until the issue has been
  resolved and disclosed.
* Avoid posting personally identifiable information, privately or publicly.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:

* Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research on this
  vulnerability
* Work with you to understand, resolve and ultimately disclose the issue in a
  timely fashion

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy and Safe Harbor

For the most up-to-date version of the policies that govern vulnerability disclosure, please consult the [HackerOne program page](https://hackerone.com/cosmos?type=team&view_policy=true).

The policy hosted on HackerOne is the official Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure policy and Safe Harbor for the Interchain Stack, and the teams and infrastructure it supports, and it supersedes previous security policies that have been used in the past by individual teams and projects with targets in scope of the program.
