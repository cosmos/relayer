# Relayer commands list

## rly

This application relays data between configured IBC enabled chains

### Synopsis

The relayer has commands for:
  1. Configuration of the Chains and Paths that the relayer with transfer packets over
  2. Management of keys and light clients on the local machine that will be used to sign and verify txs
  3. Query and transaction functionality for IBC
  4. A responsive relaying application that listens on a path
  5. Commands to assist with development, testnets, and stuff

NOTE: Most of the commands have aliases that make typing them much quicker (i.e. 'rly tx', 'rly q', etc...). Almost all commands have `--help` flag to show usage information.

### Options

```
      --config string   set config file (default "config.yaml")
  -d, --debug           debug output
  -h, --help            help for the current command
      --home string     set home directory (default "/Users/vsh/.relayer")
```

## rly query txs

Query transactions by the events they produce

### Synopsis

Search for transactions that match the exact given events where results are paginated. Each event 
takes the form of '{eventType}.{eventAttribute}={value}' with multiple events seperated by '&'. 
Please refer to each module's documentation for the full set of events to query for. Each module
documents its respective events under 'cosmos-sdk/x/{module}/spec/xx_events.md'.

```
rly query txs [chain-id] [events] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -l, --limit int   pagination limit of light clients to query for (default 100)
  -p, --page int    pagination page of light clients to to query for (default 1)
```

### Synopsis

## rly start

Start the listening relayer on a given path according to a path's strategy.

### Synopsis

Start the listening relayer on a given path. A path must have an associated relaying strategy. Starts a loop where relayer listens for events in connected chains and, if the event requires action according to the strategy (e.g. someone posted first half of the transfer in the chain A), relayer takes the required action (e.g. finish transfer with an appropriate tx in chain B)

```
