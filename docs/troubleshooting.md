# Troubleshooting


**Ensure `rly` package is properly installed**

   Run: 
   ```shell
   $ rly version
   ```

   If this returns an error, make sure you have Go installed and your Go environment is setup. Then redo [Step 1](#basic-usage---relaying-packets-across-chains).

---

## **Verify valid `chain`, `client`, and `connection`**

```shell
$ rly chains list
```

Output should show all checkboxes:
```shell
-> type(cosmos) key(✔) bal(✔) path(✔)
```

## **Verify valid `chain`, `client`, and `connection`**

```shell
$ rly paths list
```

If output:
```shell
-> chns(✘) clnts(✘) conn(✘)
```
Verify that you have a healthy RPC address. 

If:
```shell
-> chns(✔) clnts(✘) conn(✘)
```
Your client is the culprit here. Your client may be invalid or expired.

---

## **Inspect Go runtime debug data**

If you started `rly` with the default `--debug-addr` argument,
you can open `http://localhost:7597` in your browser to explore details from the Go runtime.

If you need active assistance from the Relayer development team regarding an unresponsive Relayer instance,
it will be helpful to provide the output from `http://localhost:7597/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=2` at a minimum.

**Error querying blockdata**

The relayer looks back in time at historical transactions and needs to have an index of them.

Specifically check `~/.<node_data_dir>/config/config.toml` has the following fields set:
```toml
indexer = "kv"
index_all_tags = true
```
---

**Error building or broadcasting transaction**

When preparing a transaction for relaying, the amount of gas that the transaction will consume is unknown.  To compute how much gas the transaction will need, the transaction is prepared with 0 gas and delivered as a `/cosmos.tx.v1beta1.Service/Simulate` query to the RPC endpoint.  Recently chains have been creating AnteHandlers in which 0 gas triggers an error case:

```
lvl=info msg="Error building or broadcasting transaction" provider_type=cosmos chain_id=evmos_9001-2 attempt=1 max_attempts=5 error="rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = provided fee < minimum global fee (0aevmos < ). Please increase the gas price.: insufficient fee: invalid request"
```

A workaround is available in which the `min-gas-amount` may be set in the chain's configuration to enable simulation with a non-zero amount of gas.

```
    evmos:
        type: cosmos
        value:
            key: relayer
            chain-id: evmos_9001-2
            rpc-addr: http://127.0.0.1:26657
            account-prefix: evmos
            keyring-backend: test
            gas-adjustment: 1.2
            gas-prices: 20000000000aevmos
            min-gas-amount: 1
            debug: false
            timeout: 20s
            output-format: json
            sign-mode: direct
```
